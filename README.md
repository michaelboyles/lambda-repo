Lambda Repo is a serverless [Maven repository](https://maven.apache.org/guides/introduction/introduction-to-repositories.html)
built for AWS. You deploy your own copy to host your Maven artifacts, and it can be set up in just a couple of minutes.

Lambda Repo is useful for small teams or for individuals who work across more than one machine. You can use it to push
snapshots or releases to a remote location to share artifacts. Previously that required a server running all the
time which is a waste of resources if you're not interacting with the repository very often.

### ðŸ¤” Why should I not use Lambda Repo?

It's serverless so may suffer from
[cold starts](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/operatorguide/execution-environments.html), i.e. requests might be
slower.

Pricing with a traditional server is usually more predictable.

[Sonatype's Nexus](https://www.sonatype.com/products/sonatype-nexus-repository), [JitPack](https://jitpack.io/).
